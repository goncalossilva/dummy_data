Description:
    Creates dummy data for the application. The amount of generated records is
    dependent on a base amount and a growth ratio. The base amount is related 
    to the initial amount of records to generate, which is then incremented
    based on their has_many associations using a given growth ratio.

    If the base amount is 10, the growth ratio is 2.0, GrandParents have many
    Parents and Parents have many Children, the generator will create dummy
    data for 10 GrandParents, 20 Parents and 40 Children.
    
    You can also set interactively set the amounts for each model.
    
    Finally, Dummy provides a rake file for importing the generated data.

Example:
    `rails generate dummy:data`

    Creates YAML fixtures for every model and a rake file for importing the data:
    
        Fixtures: test/dummy/data/*
        Rakefile: lib/tasks/dummy_data.rake
        Dummyfile: test/dummy/Dummyfile
        
    `rails generate dummy:data --growth-factor=1.0 --base-amount=5`

    Creates YAML fixtures for every model containing 5 fixtures each.
    
    `rails generate dummy:data --growth-factor=3.0`

    Creates YAML fixtures for every model containing N fixtures which can range 
    from 10 to 3.0*D where D is the association depth of a given model.
    
    `rails generate dummy:data --manual-amounts`
    
    Asks for the amount of records to generate for each model.
    
    `rails generate dummy:data --output-folder=test/awesome_dummy`
    
    Creates YAML fixtures for every model and places them in test/awesome_dummy/data.
